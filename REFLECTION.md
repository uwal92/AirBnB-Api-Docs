# Project Reflection

Working on this project taught me a lot about myself as a solo programmer.

The hardest part for me was **building API documentation** and working on **M4 Mocha tests**. These tasks felt overwhelming because they needed a lot of attention to detail. I struggled to stay organized and make sure I was doing everything correctly.

I learned that when I feel overwhelmed, it helps to pause, stay calm, and remind myself to ask for help when I need it. Asking questions and getting advice helped me get through the tough parts without getting stuck for too long.

I also realized that working alone can be really hard. I like the independence, but I think I would prefer working with a partner if I had the choice. Having someone to share ideas with and divide the work would make things less stressful and more fun.

Overall, this project helped me understand my strengths and what I can improve. I learned that staying calm, asking for help, and being patient with myself are really important when working on big tasks.
